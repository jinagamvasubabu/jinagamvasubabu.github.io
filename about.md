I am interested in data science, graphs, networks and practical applications of scientific methods to real world data.

I am curious and I need to learn new things every day.

I have a background in Physics and Mathematics. I have spent many years in various research labs analyzing data or designing new methods for data analysis. Over the last few years, I focused on graphs and their fascinating properties.
I got a PhD in Mathematical Physics in 2007 and worked as a researcher in academia until 2016. You can find my scientific publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=muGuSyoAAAAJ)

I am the founder of the company [Evia Cybernetics](http://www.eviacybernetics.com).
